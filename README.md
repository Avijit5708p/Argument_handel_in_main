# Argument_handel_in_main
Argument handling in the main function in C allows you to pass command-line arguments to your program. The main function can take two arguments:  int argc  and  char *argv[] .
int argc: This is the argument count. It contains the number of command-line arguments passed to the program. It always includes at least one argument (the program's name).
char *argv[]: This is the argument vector. It is an array of strings (character pointers) representing the arguments passed to the program.
